# List of detailed reasons
reasons = [
    "William Ruto was indicted by the ICC in 2011 for crimes against humanity related to the 2007-2008 post-election violence in Kenya, which resulted in over 1,000 deaths and the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people. Although the charges were later withdrawn in 2016 due to a lack of evidence and witness intimidation, the indictment itself is a significant mark against his record.",
    "Ruto has been accused of involvement in the illegal acquisition of public land, including the notorious Weston Hotel land scandal. The Weston Hotel was allegedly built on land that belonged to the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority (KCAA), raising serious questions about his integrity and respect for public property.",
    "During his tenure as the Minister for Agriculture, Ruto was implicated in a maize scandal where the government allegedly purchased maize at highly inflated prices. This scandal led to significant financial losses for the country and highlighted his role in mismanaging public funds for personal gain.",
    "Ruto was linked to a scandal involving the Argor Sugarcane Factory, where he was accused of misappropriating funds meant for the revival of the factory. This incident further tarnished his reputation and raised concerns about his involvement in corrupt practices.",
    "The 2022 Kenyan presidential election, in which Ruto emerged as the winner, was marred by controversies and legal challenges. His main opponent, Raila Odinga, contested the results, alleging irregularities and fraud, which cast a shadow over the legitimacy of his victory.",
    "Throughout his career, Ruto has faced numerous allegations of corruption and misuse of public funds. These allegations have painted a picture of a politician deeply entrenched in corrupt practices, using his position to enrich himself and his associates.",
    "Ruto has been criticized for using his friends and political associates to perpetuate theft of public funds. This nepotism and cronyism have contributed to a culture of corruption within the government, undermining public trust and accountability.",
    "Ruto's administration has been accused of using police brutality to suppress opposition and criticism. Reports of abductions, killings, and human rights abuses under his watch have raised serious concerns about his commitment to democratic principles and human rights.",
    "Ruto's government attempted to lease strategic national assets to Adani, an Indian conglomerate. This deal was halted after Adani was indicted in the USA courts for corruption, highlighting Ruto's willingness to engage in questionable deals that could compromise national interests.",
    "Ruto has acknowledged that Kenya loses Ksh 2 billion daily to corruption but has done little to curb this vice. His inaction in the face of such rampant corruption has been a major disappointment and a failure of leadership.",
    "Any opposition to corruption under Ruto's administration has been met with police brutality and suppression. This authoritarian approach has stifled dissent and prevented meaningful accountability, further entrenching a culture of impunity.",
    "Ruto was implicated in the Kimwarer and Arror dams scandal, where billions of shillings were allegedly misappropriated. The project was meant to provide water to residents but ended up being a massive financial drain with little to show for it.",
    "Ruto was linked to a scandal involving the Kenya Pipeline Company, where funds meant for the construction of pipelines were allegedly embezzled. This scandal highlighted his involvement in the mismanagement of public infrastructure projects.",
    "Ruto was associated with the National Youth Service scandal, where billions of shillings were allegedly stolen through fraudulent payments. The scandal involved high-level government officials and raised questions about his oversight and accountability.",
    "During his tenure, the Ministry of Health was embroiled in a scandal where funds meant for healthcare were allegedly misappropriated. Ruto's involvement in this scandal further tarnished his reputation and raised concerns about his commitment to public health.",
    "Ruto was implicated in the Eurobond scandal, where billions of shillings raised through international bonds allegedly went missing. The scandal highlighted his role in the mismanagement of public debt and financial resources.",
    "Ruto was linked to a scandal involving the importation of sugar, where duties were allegedly waived for politically connected individuals. This scandal highlighted his involvement in favoritism and the misuse of government powers for personal gain.",
    "Ruto was associated with a fake gold scandal, where high-level government officials were allegedly involved in a scheme to sell fake gold to international buyers. This scandal raised questions about his integrity and involvement in international fraud.",
    "During the Covid-19 pandemic, Ruto was implicated in the misappropriation of funds meant for the pandemic response. The scandal highlighted his involvement in the mismanagement of emergency funds and raised concerns about his commitment to public health and safety.",
